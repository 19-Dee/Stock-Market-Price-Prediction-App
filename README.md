## About

This application leverages machine learning algorithms to predict stock market prices, providing users with data-driven insights into potential market trends. By analysing historical price data and market indicators, the app aims to assist traders and investors in making informed decisions based on predicted price movements. We will be utilising **Google's Finance API** in order to fetch real-time and historical stock data - giving us confidence that we have up-to-date and accurate information to do our analysis/predictions.

## Application Architecture

## Flask App
Flask is the efficient way to be used as Python web framework that is innovated to produce a web development in an easier and more smoother way. It is very popular method that most of the developers use to simplify their flexibility in order to come up with an easier way to produce a website developed in Python. This is progressed through the advantages that Flask has when it collaborates with Python, such as it contributes to minimal setup, it only require a single Python file to start with, and then the development could be progressed after this step. It is also a reliable initial point to be used for beginners as well as this who are looking to develop small to medium level of applications without considering a step learning curve. 

One of the biggest strength that flask has is the adaptability, unlike other frameworks, as it does not enforce a specific project structure or force developers to adhere to strict regulations. This provides a better way to cause freedom to organise the appication in whatever way meets the developer's requirments. As well as this, Flask also helps in the integration with Jinja, that is considered to be a powerful templating engine, which allows dynamic generation of HTML content. In comparison with static HTML which only display a fixed content. This leads to the prevention of building moderns, and data-driven applications where content is constantly changing based on the backend requirements. 

Through the consideration to the above, developers can easily insert Python as syntax into HTML files, such as variables, loops, and conditionals, which would make it simple to generate dynamic web pages based on the data, or the change of any external factors. This is a strong key that makes Flask very rapid for web application development.
